# CyberSentinelAI: Autonomous AI CTF Battle System

## Project Overview

CyberSentinelAI is a groundbreaking platform that orchestrates fully autonomous Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions between two AI agents powered by Claude Sonnet 3.7. This system creates a sophisticated cyber battleground where:

- A **Red Team AI Agent** attempts to penetrate defenses and capture a flag
- A **Blue Team AI Agent** implements security measures to protect the flag

What makes this project unique is that both agents operate with complete autonomy, making strategic decisions, implementing technical solutions, and adapting to their opponent's actions without human intervention.

## Key Features

### Autonomous AI Agents

- **Self-directed strategy**: Agents independently develop and execute multi-step attack and defense plans
- **Web search capabilities**: Agents can search for techniques, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures in real-time
- **Tool acquisition**: Agents can install and configure security tools as needed
- **Adaptive tactics**: Agents analyze results and adjust strategies based on battle progression

### Sophisticated Battle Environment

- **Containerized target**: Docker-based Ubuntu 22.04 system with SSH access
- **Resource constraints**: Each agent operates within a $100 budget (~10M tokens)
- **Turn-based execution**: Structured battle flow with alternating agent actions
- **Isolated environments**: Separate execution contexts prevent cross-contamination

### Advanced Infrastructure

- **Token tracking system**: Real-time monitoring of AI resource consumption
- **Battle controller**: Manages turn execution, state persistence, and battle progression
- **Visualization dashboard**: Real-time display of battle status, actions, and costs
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed record of all agent actions and reasoning

### Evaluation Framework

- **Performance metrics**: Quantitative assessment of agent effectiveness
- **Strategy analysis**: Tools for understanding agent decision-making
- **Battle replay**: Capability to review and analyze completed battles
- **Learning system**: Framework for improving agent performance over time

## Technical Architecture

The system consists of several integrated components:

1. **Target Environment**: Docker container with the protected flag
2. **Agent Infrastructure**: Isolated execution environments with web search and tool installation capabilities
3. **Battle Controller**: Turn-based execution manager with state persistence
4. **Token Tracker**: Budget enforcement and resource monitoring
5. **Visualization System**: Real-time battle progress and cost display

## Agent Capabilities

### Red Team Agent

The offensive agent can perform reconnaissance, develop exploits, execute attacks, establish persistence, and exfiltrate the flag. Its toolkit includes:

- Web searching for exploitation techniques
- Security tool installation and configuration
- Reconnaissance operations
- Exploitation development and execution
- Command and control operations

### Blue Team Agent

The defensive agent implements system hardening, monitoring, threat detection, and incident response. Its capabilities include:

- Security tool deployment
- System hardening techniques
- Monitoring and alerting implementation
- Threat detection rules
- Incident response automation
- Deception and honeypot deployment

## Battle Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**: Environment setup and agent preparation
2. **Turn-based Execution**: Alternating Red and Blue agent actions
3. **Strategic Planning**: Each agent assesses the situation and plans next steps
4. **Action Execution**: Agents implement their strategies through commands
5. **Result Analysis**: Agents observe outcomes and adapt accordingly
6. **Battle Conclusion**: Winner determination based on flag status

## Applications and Significance

This project represents a significant advancement in autonomous cybersecurity systems with applications in:

- **Security Research**: Discovering novel attack and defense techniques
- **Training Environments**: Creating realistic cybersecurity training scenarios
- **Defense Testing**: Evaluating security measures against adaptive adversaries
- **AI Capability Research**: Exploring the strategic reasoning capabilities of large language models

CyberSentinelAI demonstrates how AI agents can operate autonomously in complex cybersecurity contexts, making strategic decisions and implementing technical solutions without human guidance.
